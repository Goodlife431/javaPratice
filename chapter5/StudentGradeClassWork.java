 // 5.17 (Student Grades) A group of five students earned the following grades: Student 1, ‘A’; stu￾dent 2, C’; student 3, ‘B’; student 4, ‘A’ and student 5, ‘B’. Write an application that reads a series
//of pairs of numbers as follows:
//a) student name
//b) student letter grade
//Your program should use a switch statement to determine how many students got a grade of ‘A’,
//how many got a grade of ‘B’, how many got a grade of ‘C’, and how many got a grade of ‘D’. Use a
//loop as needed to input the five student grades, and then finally display the results. //
